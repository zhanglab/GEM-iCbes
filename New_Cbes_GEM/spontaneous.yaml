  name: abiotic decarboxylation of acetolactate (spontaneous)
  equation: C06010[c] + C00080[c] => C00466[c] + C00011[c]
  PMID: 30009131
  comment: Acetoin is generated from pyruvate by the action of acetolactate synthase
    and the abiotic decarboxylation of acetolactate to acetoin at high temperatures
    (above 60C).
