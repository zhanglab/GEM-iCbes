HprK P also catalyzes the pyrophosphate-producing, inorganic phosphate-dependent dephosphorylation (phosphorolysis) of seryl-phosphorylated HPr (P- Ser-HPr). The two antagonistic activities of HprK P are regulated by several intracellular metabolites, which change their concentration in response to the absence or presence of rapidly metabolisable carbon sources (glucose, fructose, etc.) in the growth medium. Therefore, by controlling the phosphorylation state of HPr, HPrK P is a sensor enzyme that plays a major role in the regulation of carbon metabolism and sugar transport it mediates carbon catabolite repression (CCR), and regulates PTS-catalyzed carbohydrate uptake and inducer exclusion (By similarity)"

The scissile phosphodiester is attacked by the catalytic tyrosine of the enzyme, resulting in the formation of a DNA-(5'-phosphotyrosyl)-enzyme intermediate and the expulsion of a 3'-OH DNA strand. The free DNA strand then undergoes passage around the unbroken strand, thus removing DNA supercoils. Finally, in the religation step, the DNA 3'-OH attacks the covalent intermediate to expel the active-site tyrosine and restore the DNA phosphodiester backbone (By similarity)"
