  genes: engineered_AdhE
  name: ethanol:NAD+ oxidoreductase
  equation: C00084[c] + C00004[c] + C00080[c] <=> C00469[c] + C00003[c]
  ec:
  - 1.1.1.1
  PMID: 30009131
## add reactions associated with Rnf gene from Thermoanaerobacter sp. X514, to increase ethanol production

  genes: engineered_Rnf
  name: energy-conserving, reduced ferredoxin NAD oxidoreductase
  equation: (2) C00138[c] + C00003[c] + C00080[c] + C01330[c] => (2) C00139[c] + C00004[c] + C01330[e]
  ec:
  - 7.2.1.2
  PMID: 30009131
## test if modified the engineered pathway what happened
## try proton coupled Rnf_H
# - id: Rnf_H
#   name: energy-conserving, reduced ferredoxin NAD oxidoreductase
#   equation: (2) C00138[c] + C00003[c] + (2) C00080[c] => (2) C00139[c] + C00004[c] + C00080[e]
# - id: Mrp
#   name: Sodium-proton transport via CPA3
#   genes: PF1147 and PF1148 and PF1149 and PF1150 and PF1151 and PF1152 and PF1153
#   equation:  C01330[e] + C00080[c] <=> C01330[c] + C00080[e]
#   subsystem: Transport
# - id: R07181
#   name: Soluble hydrogenase I (SHI)
#   genes: PF0894 and PF0893 and PF0892 and PF0891
#   equation: C00282[c] + C00006[c] <=> C00005[c] + C00080[c]
#   ec: 1.12.1.3, 1.12.1.5
#   pmid: 22557999, 28295726, 26543406
#   comment: SHI and SHII utilize NADP(H) and NAD(H) as electron carriers, respectively, and while their functions have not been established, it is assumed that they can recycle some of the H2 produced by MBH under the appropriate growth conditions (pmid:26543406). So make SHI and SHII as bi-directional reaction.
