# Below are the added reactions for C. bescii engineered ethanol strain (MACB1062)
## add reactions associated with AdhE gene (from Clostridium thermocellum)
- id: R00228  # Acetyl-CoA to Acetaldehyde
  name: acetaldehyde:NAD+ oxidoreductase (CoA-acetylating)
  equation: C00024[c] + C00004[c] + C00080[c] <=> C00084[c] + C00010[c] + C00003[c]
